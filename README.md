#Summary

This repo contains the files for a 3D graphics rendering project. The project stems from my interest in linear algebra and computer science. I hope to apply the knowledge I have from linear algebra as well as C++
to create a robust codebase that others can use to visualize graphics. This project is an extension of my vector visualization project.
